PORTRAIT IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

For the landing page background, you'll need to add your black-and-white portrait photo.

Steps:
1. Rename your portrait image to "portrait.jpeg"
2. Place it in this "images" folder
3. Make sure the image is high-resolution (recommended minimum: 1920x1080px)
4. For best results, use a professional black and white portrait with good contrast

The image will be automatically scaled and centered to fill the screen while maintaining aspect ratio.

Note: If your image is in a different format (like PNG or JPG), you'll need to update the reference in the index.html file:
- Open index.html
- Find the line with: style="background-image: url('assets/images/portrait.jpeg');"
- Change "portrait.jpeg" to your image's filename
