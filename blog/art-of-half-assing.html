            <p>This is the article I wanted to write a long time but never had the cojones. ðŸ˜… Well, if it helps one person think differently, it's worth it (either that or if I get more than 30 likes, idk).</p>

            <p>I'm surprised by how many smart people use intelligence for the work itself (god-tier programmers, very technical people), but very few people use intelligence for thinking about how they work. There are many aspects to this meta-thinking - prioritizing, deep work, EQ etc. But this post is about the best one: half-assing. ðŸŒˆ</p>

            <p>Half-assing sounds like being lazy. But it's about being lazy in the right way. And it's kind of a cure to perfectionism. Let me explain! All tasks (writing code, presentation for clients, even cleaning your apartment) have a pretty clear quality target. It may be latency and accuracy of your app or a presentation with decent visuals and core concepts covered. But guess what? After you meet these targets, anything after that is pretty much wasted motion. For instance, if your client asks for 0.5s latency for an app and you deliver it, that's the win. Why push for 0.4s if it doesn't make a meaningful difference? The time spent over-optimizing could be better used elsewhere. Sounds simple, right?</p>

            <p>Well, it friggin isn't. I have heard so MANY times - "this is important for the firm, it has to be perfect". Ughm, no? It has to meet the quality target, it doesn't have to be perfect (what does "perfect" mean anyways?). The quality target may be high, yes, but is a threshold that can be met. And if you keep optimizing after that, it's a wasted motion. Sure, your app will be 0.1s faster, so there's this illusion of progress, but realistically you could have spent this time moving other projects towards their quality target.</p>

            <p class="emphasis">"Be a perfectionist about identifying good strategies, about abandoning sunk costs, about killing your darlings, about noticing when you're done. Be a perfectionist about wasting no attention. Be a perfectionist about learning from your mistakes. Perfectionism can be a powerful tool, but there's no need to point it at overachieving on metrics you don't care about."</p>

            <p>This quote perfectly captures why we should focus our perfectionism on strategies that matter, not on overachieving metrics that don't. Let's celebrate the art of intentional half-assing. ðŸ¥°</p>
